# Breath of the Wild: Memory Card Game

A front-end project/game based off of The Odin Project's "Memory Card Game" assignment. This project uses the following technologies:

- ReactJS
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Hyrule Compendium API (https://github.com/gadhagod/Hyrule-Compendium-API)

How to Play:
1. Choose from any of the magical weapons shown on the screen. Make sure to remember which one you picked.
2. After the weapons have shuffled, pick a different weapon. If you pick one that you've already selected before, the game will reset.
3. Keep selecting new weapons until you've clicked all of them exactly once. When you've reached this condition, you win the game!
